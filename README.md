## About

This project is designed to provide a robust full-stack solution with a React-based frontend, an Express API server, and MySQL for persistent data storage. It serves as a great starting point for building scalable web applications that require a clear separation between client and server logic.

## Features

- **User Interface:** Responsive React frontend.
- **API Server:** Express-based RESTful API.
- **Database Integration:** MySQL used for data storage and retrieval.
- **Environment Configuration:** Easy-to-configure settings using environment variables.
- **Modular Structure:** Clear separation of backend and frontend code for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Built With

- React
- Express
- MySQL
- Node.js

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
- **MySQL Server** installed and running.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and command-line operations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Rich-1007/CRUD-React-Express-MySQL-Tailwind.git
   cd CRUD-React-Express-MySQL-Tailwind
   ```

2. **Extract the Project (if downloaded as a ZIP).**

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   - **Backend (Express):**
     ```
     cd server
     npm install
     ```
   - **Frontend (React):**
     ```
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories (if needed) with the appropriate settings.

## Environment Variables

An example `.env` file for the backend:

```
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
```

## Usage

### Running the Backend

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

Your React app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
